## Prerequisites

To install BHM, the following is needed:

1. Reasonably up-to-date C++ compiler
2. CMake >= 2.8
3. [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

# Compilation and installation procedure

The BHM program uses CMake as its build system.

1. Create a build directory and change to it:

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build

2. Next, generate the BHM build. The simplest build with reasonable  defaults is generated by:

        $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/BHM

   The success of the build generation is indicated by the messages  similar to the following:

        -- Configuring done
        -- Generating done
        -- Build files have been written to: /where/to/install/BHM

   
   **Troubleshooting**:

     a. If the build generation fails with the message similar to:
     
            FindGSL.cmake: gsl-config/pkg-config gsl not found. Please set it manually.

     make sure that GNU Scientific Library is installed in your system.

     b. If GSL is not installed system-wide, it has to be downloaded and installed as per instructions on [its web-page](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). After installing GSL, set the environment variable to point to the GSL installation, remove the files from the unsuccessful build (if any) and generate the build files:

            $ export GSL_HOME=/path/to/gsl/installation
            $ rm -f CMakeCache.txt
            $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/BHM

3. Once the build tree successfully generated, perform the actual build:

        $ make

4. Run the tests:

        $ make test

5. Install the BHM program 

        $ make install

   This step will create files `bhm` and `generator` in subdirectory `bin/` under the installation directory specified in step 2; in our example, it would be `/where/to/install/BHM/bin`.
